### Alzheimer's Disease
#Discription
Alzeimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorders causing cognitive decline memory loss, and behavioural changes affecting
millions globally.
Also Neurodegerative disease like Alzheimer's and Parkison's involve the progressive loss of neurons and cognitive decline due to specific brain pathological changes

Summary
 Intro:  The paper by Braak and Braak presents a systematic approach to understanding neuropathological changes associated
with Alzheimer's disease. They emphasize the importance of staging these changes to better comprehend the disease's
progression and its clinical implications.

Method: The authors use post-mortem brain samples from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease to assess Alzheimer-related changes in brain tissue, identifying neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques.
The study examines various brain regions, revealing distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangles and plaque distribution across
different stages of the disease. They outline six stages of pathology, highlighting how these changes correlate with clinical
symptoms and cognitive decline. 

Result: The findings indicate that certain brain regions are affected earlier than others, providing
insights into the progression of Alzheimer's.

Discussion: The authors argue that their staging system offers a valuable framework for
understanding disease progression and can aid in diagnosis and treatment strategies. They also suggest potential implications
for future research, suggesting that further studies could enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms and lead to improved
therapeutic approaches.

Critics; Braak & Braak's 1991 article on Alzheimer's pathology has been critized for its methodology,scope,reproducibility,
and evolving scientific knowledge,necessitating ongoing research to refine our understanding

and problems on the road to therapeutics. Science, 297(5580), 353–356. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1072994


   INTRO;   Hardy and Selkoe's (2002) paper discusses the amyloid hypothesis, which suggests that amyloid-beta peptide accumulation in the brain is
a key factor in Alzheimer's disease.
   METHOD;  They review existing literature and research findings to evaluate the hypothesis's evidence and its
implications for therapeutic development.
   RESULTS; They highlight significant progress in understanding amyloid pathology, including genetic studies
linking APP and presenilin mutations to familial Alzheimer's disease and the role of amyloid plaques in neurodegeneration.
   DISCUSSION; However, theyalso address challenges like the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and translating findings into 
effective treatments.

Critics; Hardy & Selkoe's article establised the amyloid hypothesis, but ongoing research challenges this model, highlighting
the need for a broader perspective on AD pathology

neurodegeneration. Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, 19(3), 1045–1054. https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-2010-1287

   INTRO;  The paper by Iqbal and Grundke-Iqbal provides a historical overview of the discovery of tau protein and its role in Alzheimer's diseas
pathology.
    METHOD; It reviews key studies and milestones in tau research, highlighting the correlation between tau pathology and cognitive
decline in Alzheimer's patients.
   RESULT; The authors emphasize the need for continued exploration into tau-targeted interventions
    DISCUSSION; and discuss the implications of tau research for potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate Alzheimer's disease
progression.

Critics; Iqbal & Grundke.Iqbal(2010) provide valuable insights into tau proteins and Alzehimers disease pathology, but critiques suggest
futher depth or updated information could enhance its contribution to ongoing discussions

years. EMBO Molecular Medicine, 8(6), 595–608. https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.201606210

      INTRO;  Selkoe and Hardy's 2016 paper revisits the amyloid hypothesis, suggesting that the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides in the 
brain is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease.
      METHO;  They evaluate the validity and implications of this hypothesis, RESULT; citing various
evidence from genetic studies, biochemical analyses, and imaging techniques. 
   DISCUSSION;  The authors acknowledge the strengths and limitation
s of the amyloid hypothesis and suggest it should be combined with other theories for a more comprehensive understanding of
Alzheimer's disease

Critics; Selkoe and Hardy's article offers a thorough analysis of the amyloid hypothesis's history and its implications for
Alzhemer's research, but also calls for a more nuanced understanding of the disease's etiology

    INTRO;   Zetterberg and Blennow (2018) discuss the transition from CSF biomarkers to blood tests for diagnosing Alzheimer's
disease, emphasizing early detection for improved patient outcomes.
     METOOH;  They review studies comparing blood-based biomarkers and
   RESULT; find blood tests less invasive and more convenient but lack sensitivity and specificity compared to CSF biomarkers.
    DISCUSSION;  They emphasize the need for further validation in clinical settings and suggest future research to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and accessibility for
Alzheimer's disease.
