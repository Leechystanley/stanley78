### Alzheimer's Disease
#Discription
Alzeimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorders causing cognitive decline memory loss, and behavioural changes affecting
millions globally.
Also Neurodegerative disease like Alzheimer's and Parkison's involve the progressive loss of neurons and cognitive decline due to specific brain pathological changes

Summary
 Intro:  The paper by Braak and Braak presents a systematic approach to understanding neuropathological changes associated
with Alzheimer's disease. They emphasize the importance of staging these changes to better comprehend the disease's
progression and its clinical implications.

Method: The authors use post-mortem brain samples from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease to assess Alzheimer-related changes in brain tissue, identifying neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques.
The study examines various brain regions, revealing distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangles and plaque distribution across
different stages of the disease. They outline six stages of pathology, highlighting how these changes correlate with clinical
symptoms and cognitive decline. 

Result: The findings indicate that certain brain regions are affected earlier than others, providing
insights into the progression of Alzheimer's.

Discussion: The authors argue that their staging system offers a valuable framework for
understanding disease progression and can aid in diagnosis and treatment strategies. They also suggest potential implications
for future research, suggesting that further studies could enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms and lead to improved
therapeutic approaches.
