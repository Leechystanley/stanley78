### Alzheimer's Disease
#Discription
Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to function properly, leading to a decline
in cognitive abilities and memory. It accounts for 60-80% of all dementia cases and is the most common form of 
the debilitating condition. The hallmark features of Alzheimer's include the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau
protein tangles in the brain,
disrupting neuronal communication and leading to neurodegeneration and cell death.
Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease typically begin with mild memory lapses, which can escalate into more pronounced memory loss.
People may also experience changes in behavior, personality, language, and spatial awareness.
The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, but research suggests a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental
influences, and lifestyle factors contribute to its development. Age is the most significant risk factor, with most individuals
diagnosed over 65 years old. Genetic factors, such as the APOE ε4 allele, also play a role.
Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but several treatments aim to manage symptoms or slow down disease progression.
These include medications like donepezil, which temporarily improve cognitive function by increasing neurotransmitters associated
with memory and learning, and non-pharmacological interventions like cognitive therapies, physical exercise programs, and social
engagement activities.

Summary
 Intro:  The paper by Braak and Braak presents a systematic approach to understanding neuropathological changes associated
with Alzheimer's disease. They emphasize the importance of staging these changes to better comprehend the disease's
progression and its clinical implications.

Method: The authors use post-mortem brain samples from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease to assess Alzheimer-related changes in brain tissue, identifying neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques.
The study examines various brain regions, revealing distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangles and plaque distribution across
different stages of the disease. They outline six stages of pathology, highlighting how these changes correlate with clinical
symptoms and cognitive decline. 

Result: The findings indicate that certain brain regions are affected earlier than others, providing
insights into the progression of Alzheimer's.

Discussion: The authors argue that their staging system offers a valuable framework for
understanding disease progression and can aid in diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Critics; Braak & Braak's 1991 article on Alzheimer's pathology has been critized for its methodology,scope,reproducibility,
and evolving scientific knowledge,necessitating ongoing research to refine our understanding

   INTRO;   Hardy and Selkoe's (2002) paper discusses the amyloid hypothesis, which suggests that amyloid-beta peptide accumulation in the brain is
a key factor in Alzheimer's disease.
   METHOD;  They review existing literature and research findings to evaluate the hypothesis's evidence and its
implications for therapeutic development.
   RESULTS; They highlight significant progress in understanding amyloid pathology, including genetic studies
linking APP and presenilin mutations to familial Alzheimer's disease and the role of amyloid plaques in neurodegeneration.
   DISCUSSION; However, theyalso address challenges like the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and translating findings into 
effective treatments.

Critics; Hardy & Selkoe's article establised the amyloid hypothesis, but ongoing research challenges this model, highlighting
the need for a broader perspective on AD pathology

It highlights the evolution of research on tau, its function, and its implications in neurodegeneration. The authors discuss how tau
protein becomes hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimers leading to neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of the condition. This pathological process

 importance as a biomaker for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.
   
METHOD; It reviews key studies and milestones in tau research, highlighting the correlation between tau pathology and cognitive
decline in Alzheimer's patients.

#Additional information
The authors use qualitative methodology, analyzing historical documents,scientific publications
, and clinical studies to understand tau pathology over time. They highlight key milestones in tau research, including the initial
identification of tau protein and its characterization as a microtubule-associated protein. They discuss experimental approaches used
 to investigate tau's role in neurofibrillary tangles,hallmark features of Alzheimers disease. They also highlight the correlation
between tau pathology and cognitive decline emphasizing the impoetance of immunistochemecal techniques in usualizing tau deposits in the brain tissues.

   RESULT; The authors emphasize the need for continued exploration into tau-targeted interventions. The article provides detailed
analysis of the discovery of tau protein and its role in Alzheimer's disease. 

# Addtional information
The protein initially identified for stabilizing microtubules,
 has been linked to neurodegeneration when hyperphosphorylated, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles,a hallmark feature
of aAlzheimer's disease. These tangles contribute to neuronal disfunction and cell death exacerbating cognitive decline. The authors highlight
key research milestones that have elucidated the relationship between tau phosphorylation and neurodegenerative processes, emphasizing tau as a
potential therapeutic target. 
    DISCUSSION; The discovery of tau protein has significantly improved our understanding of neurofibillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
Initially a microtubule associated protein, tau stabilizes microtubules maintaing neuronal structure and function.

#Additional information
However, hyperphosphorylation
of tau leads to to its aggregation into neuro fibrillary tangles, a hallmark feature of the diesase. This disrupts normal cellular process and 
contributes to neurodegeneration. Research shows that that neurofibrillary tangles corelate more closely with cognitive decline then amyloid
plaques, suggesting tau pathology may be a more critical target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisims by which tau
contibutes to neuronal dysfunction could lead to novel treatment strategies. Further studies are exploring potential biomakers related to
the pathology to enhance early diagnosis and monitor disease progression.

Critics; Iqbal & Grundke.Iqbal(2010) provide valuable insights into tau proteins and Alzehimers disease pathology, but critiques
suggest
futher depth or updated information could enhance its contribution to ongoing discussions. a historical overview of tau protein discovery
and its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it may not adequately
address recent advancements in tau research, which has evolved significantly since 2010. The article primarily focuses on tau
pathology without discussing other critical factors in AD, such as amyloid-beta plaques or neuroinflammation. The authors also 
lack critical analysis of the methodologies used in previous studies, which could enhance understanding of how past research has
shaped current perspectives. Despite tau's significance as a biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression, the article does not
explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting tau pathology, which would have been valuable for readers interested
in translational applications of tau research.
